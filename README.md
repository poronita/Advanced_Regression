## <span style="color: #1E88E5;">Introduction</span>

Surprise Housing, a US-based real estate company, is venturing into the Australian market using data analytics to identify lucrative investment opportunities. This comprehensive dataset from Australian property sales is utilized to construct a robust regression model. The goal is to predict the true value of potential properties, aiding in decision-making for property acquisitions and understanding variables influencing house prices.

The key questions guiding this analysis include identifying influential predictive variables and determining optimal lambda values for ridge and lasso regression. This data-driven approach empowers Surprise Housing to make informed investment decisions in the Australian real estate market.

## <span style="color: #1E88E5;">Business Goal</span>

Develop a predictive model for house prices to provide insights into the relationship between prices and various factors. This model assists in strategic decision-making, optimizing investment strategy, and navigating the complexities of the real estate market.

Details of variables are provided in the [data description file](https://cdn.upgrad.com/UpGrad/temp/87f67e28-c47e-4725-ae3c-111142c7eaba/data_description.txt).

## <span style="color: #1E88E5;">Analysis</span>

The exploration begins with doubling alpha values in ridge and lasso regression, investigating shifts in model dynamics and predictor variable importance. The decision-making process between ridge and lasso, optimal lambda values, constructing models without crucial predictors, and ensuring model robustness and generalizability are addressed.
