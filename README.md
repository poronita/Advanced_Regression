<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> Surprise Housing, a US-based real estate company, is poised to make a strategic foray into the Australian market, employing data analytics to identify lucrative investment opportunities. With a keen focus on maximizing returns, the company has curated a comprehensive dataset from Australian property sales, encapsulated in a CSV file. The objective is to construct a robust regression model, utilizing regularization techniques, to predict the true value of potential properties. This predictive model not only aids in decision-making for property acquisitions but also sheds light on the significant variables influencing house prices.

The pivotal questions guiding this endeavor include identifying the variables that wield substantial predictive power over house prices and evaluating the overall efficacy of these variables in describing property values. Furthermore, the quest for an optimal lambda value in both ridge and lasso regression becomes crucial, as it directly impacts the model's ability to strike the delicate balance between accuracy and simplicity. Through this data-driven approach, Surprise Housing aims to make informed investment decisions, strategically navigating the Australian real estate landscape for optimal financial gains. </p>
